Python test automation course

Aksana Batyrova
Python is better suited for automation than other programming languages due to its characteristics: it is interpreted easy to learn, and more concise. The language is cross-platform, so applications written in it will work on any system. The advantages include an extensive set of libraries and active community support, so, most likely, the necessary module for your needs has already been written.
